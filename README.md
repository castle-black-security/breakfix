# Breakfix

## Instructions

This is a skeleton application that has 3 small issues preventing the project from running locally and building for production. Your job is to figure out what the issues are and fix them.

You'll need to [install nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) to run the project. Then run:

```bash
nvm install
npm install
```

Budget about an hour to do the exercise. You can submit by either sending us a zipped copy of the project or uploading it on GitHub and giving the link. The following are a couple of *optional* infrastructure tasks if you breeze through and finish the breakfix in way under an hour. Don't feel pressured to do them and definitely don't do more than one!
1. Deploy the project to Heroku. Send us a link to the deployed app with your submission.
2. Dockerize the project for local development and include a command for us to run to get the project up and running.

## Basic Commands

```bash
# Run dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run production server
npm start
```
foo
